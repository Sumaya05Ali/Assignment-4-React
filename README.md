# Hotel Details Application
This project is a conversion of an initial HTML and CSS project into a server-side, component-based application using React and Next.js, integrated with dynamic content from a backend API developed using Node.js and Express.js. The application retrieves hotel details dynamically based on a provided hotel ID and displays them on a detailed page. TypeScript is used for type safety, and unit tests are implemented for critical components.

## Features
- Server-side rendering using Next.js
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Dynamic API integration for hotel data using Node.js and Express.js
- Type-safe code using TypeScript
- Unit tests for critical components

## Project Structure
- Frontend: Built using React and Next.js for rendering dynamic hotel details pages.
- Backend API: Fetches hotel data using a previously developed Node.js and Express.js project.
- TypeScript: Ensures type safety and helps prevent runtime errors.
